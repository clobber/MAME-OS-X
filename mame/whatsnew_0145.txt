Happy 15th Anniversary!  Over its 15 years of existence since MAME
0.01 was released for MS-DOS with an initial library of 5 sets, MAME
has grown exponentially to the point that no one thought we would be,
boasting 18,650 different sets and operable on more OS platforms than
thought possible.  While video-based arcade games were the original
targets for MAME, the scope of the project has grown to include
documentation of virtually all coin-operated amusement devices
including gambling (video/slots), coin droppers, pinball machines and
more.  Through the efforts of the literally thousands of developers,
players and others who have provided assistance and feedback over the
project's history, we would like to thank all of them that made this
possible!

Source Changes
--------------
Rewrote tilemap.c as a C++ class. For now kept the global functions
and just inline mapped them to the class. Will do a pass soon to
actually update drivers to use the C++ methods directly. Also, the
tilemap callbacks are now delegates which should make for cleaner
integrating into modern devices and drivers going forward. 
[Aaron Giles]

Add libjpeg; converted Sliver to decompress pictures on the fly
[David Haywood, R. Belmont]

Remove support for 4bpp packed graphics. These only manifested for
drivers that used GFX_RAW support for 4bpp systems, and yet we had a
bunch of extra code to support it. Updated these drivers to do without
it and removed all the extra code for supporting it. [Aaron Giles]

tagmap is just a C++ template now. Added iterators to it as well.
Updated a few outlying uses. [Aaron Giles]

VGA: Fixed Double Scan / Maximum Scan Lines condition, and removed a

Changes for GCC 4.7 compatibility [Belegdol]

Added FLAC (lossless audio) codec support plus experimental hooks in
samples and chdman.  Bumped up CHD-CD hunk size to get better
compression ratios on both zlib and flac. [David Haywood, R. Belmont]

i386: Made stack limit checks better handle the difference between 16
and 32-bit stacks in IRET and RETF. [Barry Rodewald]

softlist: Fix entry count tracking issue [O. Galibert]

vamphalf.c: Added correct speedup for Toy Land Adventure. Demoted Mr.
Kicker to not working again. There is a serious bug with the nvram
handling (possibly due to a core bug) which causes the game to break
entirely if you get a high score and it rewrites nvram. [Dave Haywood]

i386: Made a start at Virtual 8086 Mode.  Not fully working yet,
though. Fixed an issue where two address or operand size prefixes
would cancel each other out. [Barry Rodewald]

Reinstated the old KOV protection simulation given that the ARM still
hasn't been dumped [David Haywood]

arm7: some code reorganization, used a jump table for a small speedup
[David Haywood]

i386: Fixed high bits in eflags register from being changed by POPF,
and VM and IF flags from changing depending on privilege level. Fixed
exception error codes in protected mode. Further work on virtual 8086
mode.  EMM386 will now load, but will still die a few seconds later.
[Barry Rodewald]

Enabling load of multi part softlist items on all available device
[Fabio Priuli]

ARM7: Gave ARM mode its own file & cleaned up formatting/indenting
[David Haywood]

i386: Bit more progress towards getting 386 enhanced mode Windows
running. [Carl]

beaminv.c: added color overlay [MASH]

Added support for 2 drives on IDE controller [Miodrag Milanovic]

Major bitmap-related changes throughout the system: [Aaron Giles]
There are almost certainly some regressions lurking. Let me know if
something seems busted.
Bitmaps are now strongly typed based on format. bitmap_t still exists
as an abstract base class, but it is almost never used. Instead,
format-specific bitmap classes are provided:
bitmap_ind8 == 8bpp indexed bitmap_ind16 == 16bpp indexed bitmap_ind32
== 32bpp indexed bitmap_ind64 == 64bpp indexed bitmap_rgb32 == 32bpp
RGB bitmap_argb32 == 32bpp ARGB bitmap_yuy16 == 16bpp YUY
For each format, a generic pix() method is provided which references
pixels of the correct type. The old pix8/pix16/pix32/ pix64 methods
still exist in the short term, but the only one available is the one
that matches the bitmap's pixel size. Note also that the old RGB15
format bitmaps are no longer supported at all.
Converted model1, megadriv, and stv drivers away from the RGB15 format
bitmaps.
New auto_bitmap_<type>_alloc() macros are provided for allocating the
appropriate type of bitmap.
Screen update functions now must specify the correct bitmap type as
their input parameters. For static update functions the SCREEN_UPDATE
macro is now replaced with SCREEN_UPDATE_RGB32 and SCREEN_UPDATE_IND16
macros. All existing drivers have been updated to use the correct
macros.
Screen update functions are now required for all screens; there is no
longer any default behavior of copying a "default" bitmap to the
screen (in fact the default bitmap has been deprecated). Use one of
the following to specify your screen_update callback:
MCFG_SCREEN_UPDATE_STATIC(name) - static functions
MCFG_SCREEN_UPDATE_DRIVER(class, func) - driver members
MCFG_SCREEN_UPDATE_DEVICE(tag, class, func) - device members
Because the target bitmap format can now be deduced from the screen
update function itself, the MCFG_SCREEN_FORMAT macro is no longer
necessary, and has been removed. If you specify a screen update
callback that takes a bitmap_ind16, then the screen will be configured
to use a 16bpp indexed bitmap, and if you specify a callback that
takes a bitmap_rgb32, then a 32bpp RGB bitmap will be provided.
Extended the bitmap classes to support wrapping a subregion of another
bitmap, and cleaner allocation/resetting. The preferred use of bitmaps
now is to define them directly in drivers/devices and use allocate()
or wrap() to set them up, rather than allocating them via
auto_bitmap_*_alloc().
Several common devices needed overhauls or changes as a result of the
above changes:
 * Reorganized the laserdisc base driver and all the laserdisc drivers
    as modern C++ devices, cleaning the code up considerably. Merged
    ldsound device into the laserdsc device since modern devices are
    flexible enough to handle it.
 * Reorganized the v9938 device as a modern C++ device. Removed
    v9938mod.c in favor of template functions in v9938.c directly.
 * Added independent ind16 and rgb32 callbacks for TMS340x0 devices.
 * All video devices are now hard-coded to either ind16 or rgb32
    bitmaps. The most notable is the mc6845 which is rgb32, and
    required changes to a number of consumers.
 * Added screen_update methods to most video devices so they can be
    directly called via MCFG_SCREEN_UPDATE_DEVICE instead of creating
    tons of stub functions.
Added new template device_delegate which wraps a regular delegate and
includes a string pointer to a device tag, which can be simply
resolved later. Converted the screen_update delegates to to be based
on this. Changed the mechanism by which screen formats are auto-
deduced. Converted SCREEN_EOF to use these delegates as well, so now
there is MCFG_SCREEN_EOF_STATIC/ DRIVER/DEVICE just like
MCFG_SCREEN_UPDATE.

Death to SCREEN_EOF, which was ambiguously called either at the start
or end of VBLANK depending on the video flag
VIDEO_UPDATE_AFTER_VBLANK. Replaced with SCREEN_VBLANK callbacks which
are called both at the start and end of VBLANK, so you can operate
either way, and be explicit about it. Updated all callers. Also
updated screen_device to use device timers and some other minor
cleanups.

Beginning to implement page faults [Carl]

Created new testcpu driver that shows how to develop an empty test
driver that (ab)uses the core to single step a CPU executing arbitrary
instructions and capturing before/after state and tracking memory.
Currently this driver is always compiled, but is not referenced in
mame.lst. [Aaron Giles]

Cleanup of bitmap classes now that formats and bpp are dictated
strictly by the type. Also added code to more aggressively align the
bitmap base and rowbytes, and create a resize method which attempts to
re-use existing memory rather than always reallocating. [Aaron Giles]

i386: Added I/O permissions. [Carl]

Added new method screen_device::register_screen_bitmap which allocates
a given bitmap to match the screen size and resizes it as appropriate
when the screen size changes. Updated all the obvious spots in the
code where this could be leveraged. [Aaron Giles]
Move allocate/resize methods in the bitmap classes down into bitmap_t
because they no longer have any dependency on the bitmap format or
type.
Ensured that the bitmap's palette remains set across a resize call (it
is lost doing an allocate).

[N64] Various changes: [MooglyGuy, Happy]
 * Converted AI / VI / MI / RI / SI / PI into a modernized device
 * PI DMA now takes place after an appropriate delay to simulate
    transfer time
- SP DMA no longer rejects transfers of 0 bytes (should transfer one
8-byte word)

x87: fix for single-precision operations [Peter Ferrie]

Capcom ZN-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
 * Redumped and fixed MASK ROMs in ts2, ts2j to match real pcb
    (Smitdogg, The Dumping Union)
 * Minor fixes

i8251: Implemented transmit and receive data callbacks [Barry
Rodewald]

arm7: implemented MMU permission faults [Tim Schuerewegen]

arm7: return correct MMU ID Code register values for ARM920T/ARM7500
[Tim Schuerewegen]

s3c24xx: lots of changes for future Happy Fish 302-in-1 and Palm Z22
(mess) drivers [Tim Schuerewegen]

chdman: fixed -extractcd of images with postgaps.  CHDs do not need
reconversion, this was an -extractcd problem only. [R. Belmont]

Implemented every single documented x87 co-processor opcodes in 386+
CPU cores [Angelo Salese]

Converted bitmap_t and rectangle into proper classes. Replaced
BITMAP_ADDR* macros with bitmap->pix* functions, and moved
bitmap_fill() to bitmap->fill() among other similar changes. Bitmap
fields now only available via accessors. Replaced sect_rect with &=
and union_rect with |= operators for rectangle classes. Some general
cleanup as a result of these changes. [Aaron Giles]

Implemented generic functions for RDMSR and WRMSR opcodes in Pentium
CPU core (i.e. no MSR is actually hooked up so far) [Angelo Salese]

Hooked up device in Savage Quest, dies at floppy error [Angelo Salese]

Hooked up devices for X-Tom 3d, gets to BOOT error if you soft reset
once [Angelo Salese]

segae.c: Updated driver to use the implementation from
src/emu/video/315_5124.c and modernized driver.
[Enik Land, Wilbert Pol]

Bulk converted cliprect * to cliprect & across the system. This makes
cliprects mandatory everywhere. In general, cliprects were being
correctly passed through the video side of most drivers already, so it
is mostly a semantic change. Note that with my previous change,
bitmaps have cliprects, so if you just want to clip to the bitmap's
boundaries, pass bitmap->cliprect() instead of NULL (which is no
longer permitted). [Aaron Giles]

68HC05: CLR instruction should not affect the carry flag.  Verified
with Freescale programmer's manual. [R. Belmont]

Hooked up basic devices in Queen and Midway Quicksilver HWs [Angelo
Salese]

mcr.c: added twotiger stereo 8-track tape sample playback
[italie, Mr. Do, hap]

Bulk conversion of bitmap_t * to bitmap_t & . With this change the
parameters for the global SCREEN_UPDATE callback match the parameters
for the driver_device version. Added allocate() and deallocate()
methods to bitmap_t to permit cleaner handling of bitmaps in drivers
and modern devices. [Aaron Giles]

m680x0: fix case where the MMU trashed memory [R. Belmont]

Removed machine.generic.tmpbitmap, VIDEO_START(generic_bitmapped), and
SCREEN_UPDATE(generic_bitmapped). In their place, each screen_device
now maintains a default bitmap which is automatically copied to the
screen on each update if no SCREEN_UPDATE function is provided and if
no driver_device::video_update override is present. This bitmap can be
found by querying the screen's new default_bitmap() method.
[Aaron Giles]

Hooked up devices and flash loading for Funky Ball, game currently dies
at a Voodoo color DAC register check [Angelo Salese]

Removed old C-based interface to astrings. astring exists only as a
class now. Updated all stragglers (mostly tools) to use the class
form. [Aaron Giles]

[MCS48] Fixed I8021/I8022 clock divider. [Curt Coder]

CPS-3 update [Team CPS-1]:
 * Dumped and added Street Fighter III 3rd Strike Euro BIOS, unlocked
    2 new sets
 * Reordered all sets per release date
 * Minor fixes

ARM7: Fixed 39-in-1 booting. [Tim Schuerewegen]

aquarium.c: removed region hack, fixed offtune music, fixed testmode
[hap]

chdman: don't be case sensitive on the input type extension
[R. Belmont]

OS/2 updates [KO Myung-Hun]

Fix four spc700 opcodes which didn't disassemble correctly [kevtris]

i386: Moved stack changes to be after protection checks in RETF and
IRET Made ARPL protected mode only Added protection checks when MOVing
to a segment register. [Barry Rodewald]

Added delayed interrupts in idectrl to enable booting on some older
bioses [Carl]

scsihd.c: Get sector size from CHD metadata to support old 256
bytes/sector SASI drives, and allow hard disk image subdevices.
[Curt Coder]

started converting steppers to simulate actual behavior in a more
logical way, rather than using hardcoded tables [J. Wallace]

PGM driver cleanups. [David Haywood]

Rainbow Island driver cleanups + rename to avoid mess conflict
[David Haywood]

Improved puzzli2 protection simulation [iq132]
