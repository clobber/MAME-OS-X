Source Changes
--------------
Converted Super Shanghai Dragon's Eye to use the common deco video
files functions, fixing a rowscroll bug in it [David Haywood]

Fix font loading in sdlmame. BDF files are just loaded as TTF by
TTF_OpenFont. Load is now protected by a magic check. Also fixed a bug
in SDL1.3 keyboard mapping and changed SDL1.3 code to be compatible
with recent 1.3 API changes. [Couriersud]

sdl-config flags are now separated into INCFLAGS and COMFLAGS in
sdl.mak. This fixes "make depend". [Couriersud]

softlist.c: split the <info> field (added some time ago to handle
compatibility requirements) into  <info> and <sharedfeat>. the former
stays tied to the whole software entry, the latter gets inherited by
each part. [Fabio Priuli]

Added device_t::memory() to fetch a reference to the memory interface,
or assert if not present. [Aaron Giles]

Split address_space::install_[legacy_]handler into
install_[legacy_]read_handler, install_[legacy_]write_handler, and
install_[legacy_]readwrite_handler. [Aaron Giles]

Added variants of address_space handler installers which don't take
mirror or mask parameters, since this is by far the most common case.
[Aaron Giles]

Deprecated API cleanup. [Aaron Giles]
   cpu_suspend                   ==> device_suspend 
   cpu_resume                    ==> device_resume 
   cpu_yield                     ==> device_yield
   cpu_spin                      ==> device_spin
   cpu_spinuntil_trigger         ==> device_spin_until_trigger
   cpu_spinuntil_time            ==> device_spin_until_time
   cpu_spinuntil_int             ==> device_spin_until_interrupt
   cpu_eat_cycles                ==> device_eat_cycles
   cpu_adjust_icount             ==> device_adjust_icount
   cpu_triggerint                ==> device_triggerint
   cpu_set_input_line            ==> device_set_input_line
   cpu_set_input_line_vector     ==> device_set_input_line_vector
   cpu_set_input_line_and_vector ==> device_set_input_line_and_vector 
   cpu_set_irq_callback          ==> device_set_irq_callback

   device_memory(device)                ==> device->memory() 
   device_get_space(device, spacenum)   ==> device->memory().space(spacenum) 
   cpu_get_address_space(cpu, spacenum) ==> cpu->memory().space(spacenum) 
   cputag_get_address_space(mach, tag, spacenum) ==> mach->device("tag")->memory().space(spacenum)
   cputag_get_clock(mach, tag)          ==> mach->device("tag")->unscaled_clock() 
   cputag_set_clock(mach, tag, hz)      ==> mach->device("tag")->set_unscaled_clock(hz)

Created new enum type address_spacenum for specifying an address space
by index. Update functions and methods that accepted an address space
index to take an address_spacenum instead. Note that this means you
can't use a raw integer in ADDRESS_SPACE macros, so instead of 0 use
the enumerated AS_0. [Aaron Giles]

Standardized the project on the shortened constants AS_* over the
older ADDRESS_SPACE_*. Removed the latter to prevent confusion. Also
centralized the location of these definitions to memory.h. [Aaron Giles]

Converted DECO BAC06 tilemap (used by dec0.c) to be a device, reducing
code duplication [David Haywood]

Deprecate the old memory_install_* macros. Dynamic installation is now
handled directly by calling methods on the address_space, which have
been expanded with aliases to cover all previous situations. In
addition, variants with no mirror or mask value are provided to cover
the common cases: [Aaron Giles]

   memory_install_read*_handler(space, begin, end, mirror, mask, handler)
     ==> space->install_legacy_read_handler(begin, end [, mirror, mask], FUNC(handler))

   memory_install_write*_handler(space, begin, end, mirror, mask, handler)
     ==> space->install_legacy_write_handler(begin, end [, mirror, mask], FUNC(handler))

   memory_install_readwrite*_handler(space, begin, end, mirror, mask, rhandler, whandler) 
     ==> space->install_legacy_readwrite_handler(begin, end [, mirror, mask], FUNC(rhandler), FUNC(whandler))

   memory_install_read*_device_handler(space, device, begin, end, mirror, mask, handler) 
     ==> space->install_legacy_read_handler(*device, begin, end [, mirror, mask], FUNC(handler))

   memory_install_write*_device_handler(space, device, begin, end, mirror, mask, handler) 
     ==> space->install_legacy_write_handler(*device, begin, end [, mirror, mask], FUNC(handler))

   memory_install_readwrite*_device_handler(space, device, begin, end, mirror, mask, rhandler, whandler) 
     ==> space->install_legacy_readwrite_handler(*device, begin, end [, mirror, mask], FUNC(rhandler), FUNC(whandler))

   memory_install_read_port(space, begin, end, mirror, mask, port) 
     ==> space->install_read_port(begin, end [, mirror, mask], port)

   memory_install_read_bank(space, begin, end, mirror, mask, bank) 
     ==> space->install_read_bank(begin, end [, mirror, mask], bank)

   memory_install_rom(space, begin, end, mirror, mask, ptr) 
     ==> space->install_rom(begin, end [, mirror, mask], ptr)

   memory_install_ram(space, begin, end, mirror, mask, ptr) 
     ==> space->install_ram(begin, end [, mirror, mask], ptr)

   memory_unmap_read(space, begin, end, mirror, mask) 
     ==> space->unmap_read(begin, end [, mirror, mask])

   memory_nop_read(space, begin, end, mirror, mask) 
     ==> space->nop_read(begin, end [, mirror, mask])

uiimage.c: Improved File Manager usage (in the internal UI) by
catching char inputs and searching for matching names among files and
directories [Fabio Priuli]

some work on the 3 games in dec8.c which use the bac06
tilemaps[David Haywood]

Converted Act Fancer, Trio the Punch and Mad Motor to use the common
deco video functions [David Haywood]

Converted Stadium Hero driver to use the common Deco video functions
[David Haywood]

Cleanup of machine.h. Shuffled some fields around, and moved several
to private member variables with accessors: [Aaron Giles]

   machine->m_respool     ==> machine->respool()
   machine->config        ==> machine->config()
   machine->gamedrv       ==> machine->system()
   machine->m_regionlist  ==> machine->first_region()
   machine->sample_rate   ==> machine->sample_rate()

Converted Pocket Gal to use the common deco video routines
[David Haywood]

Started moving common deco MXC06 sprite controller code to it's own
device files, reducing code duplication [David Haywood]

Converted Act Fancer to use common deco sprite code [David Haywood]

Converted Vapor Trail to use the common deco sprite functions
[David Haywood]

Converted Stadium Hero, Cobra-Command, Psycho-Nics Oscar to use the
common deco sprite functions [David Haywood]

Removed redundant machine items from address_space and device_t.
Neither machine nor m_machine are directly accessible anymore. Instead
a new getter machine() is available which returns a machine reference:
[Aaron Giles]

   space->machine->xxx   ==>  space->machine().xxx 
   device->machine->yyy  ==>  device->machine().yyy

Globally changed all running_machine pointers to running_machine
references. Any function/method that takes a running_machine takes it
as a required parameter (1 or 2 exceptions). Being consistent here
gets rid of a lot of odd &machine or *machine, but it does mean a very
large bulk change across the project. [Aaron Giles]

Remove redundant item cpu from address_space, in favor of
space->device(). [Aaron Giles]

Two hash_collections can only match if they have at least one matching
hash. [Aaron Giles]

If we get an error parsing options, see if there was no command and
what looks like an invalid system name. In that case, provide
suggestions for the system name instead of reporting the options
error. [Aaron Giles]

Move overridable device->rom_region(),
device->machine_config_additions(), and device->input_ports() to
protected methods. Added non-virtual wrappers around them.
[Aaron Giles]

Implemented karnov style sprites in its own file, shared with karnov
and dec8 drivers [David Haywood]

Fixed multiwidth sprites in decmxc06.c, removed code which appeared to
serve no purpose other than to break the birdtry gfxdecode in
machine/dec0.c [David Haywood]

Added new macro MACHINE_CONFIG_DERIVED_CLASS() which works just like
MACHINE_CONFIG_DERIVED() except you can specify an alternate
driver_device class. Used this in the 8080bw.c games which require an
_8080bw_state, but derive from mw8080bw_root which has the base class
mw8080bw_state. [Aaron Giles]

lordgun.c: Corrected Dipswitch names and added dipswitch locations to 
Lord of Gun & Alien Challenge [Brian Troha]

tumbleb.c: Corrected Dipswitch names and locations for Choky! Choky! 
[Brian Troha]



New clones added
----------------
Fashion Gambler (Set 2)  [Team Europe]
AAcrobatic Dog-Fight (USA) [Tirino73]



New games marked as GAME_NOT_WORKING
------------------------------------
Jyunai - Manatsu no First Kiss [The Dumping Union, alien_mame]
BiKiNikko - Okinawa de Ippai Shityaimashita [The Dumping Union, alien_mame]

Source Changes
--------------
Decreased color saturation and alpha of internal fake shifter layout
to make it less distracting. [hap]

Fix OS/2 compile [K.O. Myung-Hun]

Various Aristocrat Mk4 / Mk5 fixes [Palindrome]

Documented Aristocrat Mk4 init procedure [Heihachi_73]

Implemented proper vblank read-back on Aristocrat Mk-4 HW
[Angelo Salese]

naomi: Reorganized the driver to put games in order by type and put
similar functionality together [f205v]

New driver for Winners Circle (Corona), dual CPU hardware.
[Roberto Fresca]

Exposed the M68000 supervisor flag for external MMUs to determine the
current address space. [Curt Coder]

Removed unnecessary machine parameter from device-specific
input_port_read. [Curt Coder]

Exposed the complete Function Code of the M68000 (instead of just FC2
as previously). [Curt Coder]

Corona.c: Fixed the visible screen area to improve the Winners Circle
aspect. Also fixed visible screen area and rotate properly the RE-800
sets. Minor clean-ups. [Roberto Fresca]

Converted core_options to a class. Removed a bunch of marginal
functionality in favor of alternate mechanisms. Errors are now
reported via an astring rather than via callbacks. Every option must
now specify a type (command, integer, float, string, boolean, etc).
Command behavior has changed so that only one command is permitted.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed fileio system to accept just a raw searchpath instead of an
options/option name combination. [Aaron Giles]

Created emu_options class dervied from core_options which wraps core
emulator options. Added mechanisms to cleanly change the system name
and add/remove system-specific options, versus the old way using
callbacks. Also added read accessors for all the options, to ensure
consistency in how parameters are handled. Changed most core systems
to access emu_options instead of core_options. Also changed
machine->options() to return emu_options. [Aaron Giles]

Created cli_options class derived from emu_options which adds the
command-line specific options. Updated clifront code to leverage the
new class and the new core behaviors. cli_execute() now accepts a
cli_options object when called. [Aaron Giles]

Updated both SDL and Windows to have their own options classes,
derived from cli_options, which add the OSD-specific options on top of
everything else. Added accessors for all the options so that queries
are strongly typed and simplified. [Aaron Giles]

Updated nmk/olympia/pacific/pce/phoenix/rare/seibu/seta to
driver_devices. [Atari Ace]

Updated sigma/stern/subsino/tatsumi/tch/tecfri/technos/tehkan to
driver_devices. [Atari Ace]

roul (roul.c) [stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the Z80 code)

ksys573: Fix some wrong machine driver selections [O. Galibert]

Allow serial receive without ES enabled. [Couriersud]

sgnascar: Added dump of mask ROMs [Guru, R. Belmont]

Added correct bitswap for point blank 3 [smf].

inptport: Add existence and used bits interface for automatic
controller adaptation [O. Galibert]

Converted psx cpu core to c++ [smf]

Corona.c driver improvements. A lot of input/output work, accurate
periodic interrupt timing for sound CPU, meters, DIP switches, and
other minor things. We got Winners Circle 82 playable. [Roberto
Fresca]

More improvements to corona.c driver. Splitted new machine, memory
map, and complete multiplexed inputs/outputs for Lucky Roulette type
games. Also added NVRAM and inverted blitter [Roberto Fresca]

Implemented MC6845 row/column addressing mode. [Curt Coder]

Make shift/alt+right work on channel volume sliders (fractions between
0 and 1 were always rounded down) [hap]

splash.c driver improvements. [Tomasz Slanina]
 * The Return of Lady Frog : added sound
 * Funny Strip : added sound, patched few more protection checks, fixed
    sprite ram access

Added inputs to Tetris Fighters - game now boots. [Tomasz Slanina]

Lot of improvements/changes to corona.c driver. Input/output work and
new set supported. Redumped the winner82 sound program. [Roberto Fresca]

SDL: Fix uimodekey for MESS [Barry Rodewald, R. Belmont]

More work on corona.c driver. [Roberto Fresca] 
 - Cleaned up and improved memory maps
 - Added NVRAM to all winners circle sets
 - Fixed the ay8910 clock for winners circle 82 type to match the other 
    hardware. 
 - Fixed a blitter buffer to bitmap problem. 
 - Reparented the sets. 
 - Added new technical notes.

carjmbre: [hap]
 * use 4 bit clut instead of 3 bit
 * calculate palette with resnet info from Popper (same year, same
    company, very similar hardware)
 * make bgcolor emulation more logical
 * small cleanups

Use correct roms for the Japanese 1941 set [Brian Troha]

Fixed sound regression with Mission 660 [Angelo Salese]

Major toaplan2.c updates  [Alex Jackson]
 * Some sets reparented and renamed as well as a cleanup of source
    comments: grindstm (parent), vfive (clone) kingdmgp (parent),
    shippumd (clone) The set formerly known as "sstrikera" is now
    "sstriker" and is now the parent of mahoudai (clone). Reverted
    batrid to batrider and bkraid to bbakraid.
 * Put common init code into MACHINE_START, leaving DRIVER_INITs only
    for games that actually need unique initialization.
 * Dead code cleanup: Removed old hacks and some no-longer-used used
    member variables from the driver class.
 * ROM banking cleanup: Added a device address map for the OKI in
    fixeightbl. Stopped misusing the bank system for memory that isn't
    actually bankswitched (fixeightbl again) Simplified the Z80 ROM
    banking (and loading) in the Raizing games.
 * Address map cleanup: Unified 8-bit shared RAM handling between the
    Z80-based and the V25-based games. Replaced lots of pointless
    READ_HANDLERs with AM_RAM_WRITE. Moved fixeight EEPROM handling
    into the input ports instead of using READ/WRITE_HANDLERs.
    Incidentally, this makes toaplan2.c the very first MAME driver to
    use the AM_READWRITE_PORT macro.
 * Removed IPT_VBLANK input ports (no longer used since the video
    rewrite)
 * Removed Truxton 2 player 2 "button 4" (after confirming that the
    game never reads it) and changed player 1 "button 4" to an
    IPT_OTHER not bound to any key by default, since it's clearly some
    kind of test/debug input not meant to be hooked up in a regular
    cabinet (for one thing, it works whether you're actually playing
    or in attract mode)
 * Added button 3 to Batsugun Special Version. It's a full auto fire
    button like Cave games have. The service mode input test doesn't
    show it, presumably because Toaplan didn't bother to update the
    service mode code from the original version of the game.
 * Fixed region jumpers and dipswitches in many sets, based on
    analysis of the program code and strings in the ROMs.
 * Added a #define to optionally make Truxton 2 stereo (commented out
    by default). See the comments at the top of the driver and in the
    MACHINE_CONFIG.
 * Corrected kbash ROM names, thanks to information from Charles
    MacDonald. Also fixed inconsistent ROM naming between some of the
    batrider clones.
 * Loaded bbakraid default EEPROM as a ROM rather than hardcoding the
    contents into the driver.
 * Completely removed audio/toaplan2.c, which isn't needed any more now
    that all the V25s are decrypted and hooked up.

Technical changes to reel games.  [James Wallace]
 * Fixed lamp timing in MPU4 and laid groundwork for MPU3 support in
    the steppers (I've also cleared up the reel code in drivers).
 * Removed some unneeded timing code.
 * BwB support is here, but preliminary, it's mainly to show people
    how the CHR chip might work in those games.

Fixed enormous memory consumption when iterating through all drivers 
like -romident does. [Aaron Giles]

Converted namco/thepit/toaplan/unico/upl/valadon/veltmjr/venture/
vsystem/zaccaria to driver_device. Also simplified unico and 
disentangled gridlee from balsente. [Atari Ace]

Breaks some driver entanglements to simplify future driver_device
conversion efforts: [Atari Ace]
 * taito_f3 is disentangled from a number of other drivers by using an
    AM_SHARE tag instead of a common variable.
 * Several drivers are made into explicit subclasses of other drivers:
    8080bw from mw8080bw, missb2 from bublbobl, quasar from cvs,
    taito_x from seta.
 * arcadecl is separated from rampart by duplicating the bitmap
    rendering code.
 * jaleco decryption code is moved to jalcrpt.c.
 * cischeat is separated from megasys1 by duplicating some video code.
 * mcr3 is partly separated from mcr.
 * machine/midwunit.c is split into wunit and xunit files with some
    code duplication.
 * midtunit gfx_rom variables are made distinct from midyunit
    variables, making midyunit independent of midtunit.
 * contants in namconb1 are duplicated/renamed in namcofl.
 * namcos2 uses of namcos21 are eliminated by introducing
    namcos2_kickstart.
 * toypop is separated from mappy by duplicating some video code.

Move non-buffered spriteram drivers away from using the generic
spriteram in favor of using spriteram in their own driver_device
classes. [Atari Ace]

Fix long-standing bug in ABS flags in ADSP21xx core.
[Christophe Jaillet]

Removed some legacy NVRAM_HANDLERs in favor of NVRAM devices.
[Aaron Giles]

Added M48T37 variant to timekpr.c. Fixed some bugs that caused
registers to be initialized to 0xff and caused odd behavior. Updated
to modern device timers. [Aaron Giles]

Converted vegas to use M48T37 instead of its own implementation.
[Aaron Giles]

Attached emu_options to the machine_config, and the running_machine
inherits it now. [Aaron Giles]

Mapped KEYCODE_BACKSLASH2 to the OEM_102 key (located between LShift
and Z on international keyboard layouts). [Curt Coder]

Fix micro3d 8051 serial RX, todo: still needs CLEAR behind a 1 cycle
callback [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed parsing of uimodekey from .ini on SDL [Fabio Priuli]

Improved inputs and complete DIP switches to Lucky Roulette Plus.
Also, added new support for Ruleta RCI. [Roberto Fresca]

model3: add protection data for oceanhun (game still doesn't boot)
[Ville Linde]

galdrvr.c: Added background color split to Anteater. [hap]

Convert a number of drivers to use their own private spriteram instead
of the generic one. Only drivers needing buffered spriteram should use
the shared generic version for now. [Atari Ace]

Continued eliminating global/static variables by moving them to the
driver_device classes.  Mostly drivers from misc.a, and some drivers
recently which had dependencies removed. [Atari Ace]

Fixed Z80-DART transmit word length. [Curt Coder]

Decouple memory_region parameters from the ROMREGION flags. [Aaron Giles]

path_iterator::next() now takes an optional filename to append to the
path. [Aaron Giles]

Fix pleiades colours (high/low palette bits exchanged). [Couriersud]

Added DEVICE_SELF_OWNER support for device callbacks. [Curt Coder]

Moved anteateruk/anteaterg to galdrvr.c [hap]

Added possibility of altering default input port setting for devices.
[Miodrag Milanovic]

Galaxian driver: Fixed sprite X offset. [hap]

Continued moving global/static variables to the driver_device classes.
[Atari Ace]

Remove unused static handler entries. Also ensure that subsequent
mapping/ unmapping of static memory types does not change the memory
parameters. This fixes the case where dynamically unmapping memory
could lead to incorrectly reported offsets. [Aaron Giles]

Remove some straggling const address_space references, and get rid of
explicit const_casts in memory.h. [Aaron Giles]

Dedicated galxwars cabs are not b/w but have color maps For now, use
proms from another game and mark sets as bad dump/wrong colors [hap]

contra.c: Changed main CPU to HD6309 as seen on PCB, and set interrupt
source to k007121. [hap]

Add driver_device classes for drivers that don't have any variables,
for consistency (and future development). [Atari Ace]

Further decoupled some driver files to help driver_device conversions.
[Atari Ace] 
 1. cclimber and galaxian audio code and seibuspi decryption code get 
     their own includes. 
 2. galpani2 video declarations are moved from kaneko16.h to their 
     own file. 
 3. cchance and champbwl subclass from tnzs, xevious/bosco/digdug 
     subclass from galaga and vmetal subclasses from metro. 
 4. yvg608 is made independent of namcond1 
 5. ettrivia duplicates the palette code from naughtyb 
 6. mshuttle decryption code is moved into galaxian. 
 7. tetrisp2_draw_sprites is split into two versions, one for ms32.c, one

Source Changes
--------------
Rewrote IOX key matrix device implementation, used by Super Real
Mahjong Part 2/3 [Angelo Salese]

Removed ROM patches and added working player 2 inputs in Super Real
Mahjong Part 3 [Angelo Salese]

Fix compiling on GCC 4.6 prerelease [Belegdol]

Added information screen output for any game known to have bad or
missing data in order to better inform the user as to the reason their
emulation may not work as expected.  [Alex Jackson]

Removed ROM patch in Super Real Mahjong Part 2 [Angelo Salese]

Cleaned up iox implementation in Speed Attack [Angelo Salese]

valid save types on a case-by-case basis. Updated the cosmac CPU core 
to do this for its mode and state enums, which were previously failing.
[Aaron Giles]

mame_file is now emu_file and is a class. It is required to pass a
core_options object to the constructor, along with a search path. This
required pushing either a running_machine or a core_options through
some code that wasn't previously ready to handle it. emu_files can be
reused over multiple open/close sessions, and a lot of core code
cleaned up nicely as things were converted to them. [Aaron Giles]

Created a file_enumerator class for iterating over files in a 
searchpath. This replaces the old mame_openpath functions. [Aaron Giles]

Changed machine->options() to return a reference. [Aaron Giles]

Removed public nvram_open() and fixed jchan/kaneko16 to stop directly
saving NVRAM. [Aaron Giles]

[Curt Coder]

Used the common MC68901 device in micro3d.c. [Curt Coder]

salarymc: CD redumped
[Roberto Malone, Yohji, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

sigmab98: added preliminary sound to the Sammy medal games
[Andrew Gardner]

tms9928a.c: Fixed colors in multicolor mode [Michael Zapf]

i386: Changed READ/WRITEPORT macros to inline functions to properly
support aligned vs. unaligned writes. Fixes regressions in MESS for
all drivers using the PCI bus and possibly others.  [Dirk Best]

Input ports can now be added to device, names are formed as sub tags
from parent device tag. [Miodrag Milanovic]

OKI MSM9810 : Added preliminary ADPCM2 support.
[Andrew Gardner, Lord Nightmare]

PSX: add DMA mode used for CD transfers on home system, fix DMA bug
that caused home system to freeze. [pSXAuthor, Harmony, R. Belmont]

Hash generation and general cleanup. New class hash_collection holds
and manages a collection of hashes, and can be built from an internal
format string which is stored with each ROM. Also compacted the form 
of the hash strings used for ROMs, and fixed verification/hashing of 
non-ZIPped files. [Aaron Giles]

snes_snd.c: fixed save state error [Fabio Priuli]

circus.c: Improved interrupt handling: circus generates them the same
way as ripcord (based on sprite-bg collision), robotbwl doesn't
generate interrupts at all. [hap]

Updated DIPS and Dip Locations based on documents posted by Laschek at
KLOV.  [Tafoid]

SDL: GLSL now works for all pixel formats; fixed memory leak on
textures [cgwg]

Eliminate statics/globals in drivers jpm/kaneko/maygay/meadows/merit/
metro/midcoin/midw8080/midway/msx/namco. [Atari Ace]

Convert dooyong/edevices/eolith/exidy/gaelco/gottlieb/igs/

 * Split part of the driver include into a separate multi-driver
    include file (audio/exidy.h audio/exidy440.h audio/wiping.h
    machine/segag80.h)
 * Moved code to a new file/include to be referenced in multiple
    drivers (ms32crpt.[ch] opwolf.c rainbow.c)
 * Duplicated some code (palette related) between drivers (mainsnk
    rollrace sslam)
 * Moved a driver specific routine to a generic device file (atarimo)
 * Cleaned up a few include files (cubocd32 cidelsa metalmx seicross
    thoop2).

Fixed sound issues in Pollux, Gulf Storm and The Last Day
[Tomasz Slanina]

Updated LH5801 CPU core [Sandro Ronco]
 * Added IO_SPACE and updated all access in ME1 memory for use it.
 * Implemented interrupts.
 * Fixed the flags in the ROL/ROR/SHL/SHR opcodes.
 * Fixed decimal add/sub opcodes.

i386 - Fix for exceptions that require the return address to point to
the instruction at fault. [Barry Rodewald]

Fix disassembler override hook [Aaron Giles]

Fix reads for 32-bit handlers on 64-bit CPUs too. [R. Belmont]

clone chips, whereas it does on the original TI-made ones. Fixes Sega
Master System 'Vigilante' music [Lord Nightmare, Enik]

Modified video update system: [Miodrag Milanovic] 
 * Screen update function is now per screen device (it was before but 
    was attached to machine driver)

      MCFG_VIDEO_UPDATE -> MCFG_SCREEN_UPDATE 
      MCFG_VIDEO_EOF -> MCFG_SCREEN_EOF

 * EOF is now executed for all screens, so for all existing it is
    defined just for one screen. This part will be updated in future.

Source Changes
--------------
arm7: Fix for "MOV LR, Rx" (where Rx bit 0 = 1) + "F800" situation.
This fixes the lockup in GBA "Golden Sun: The Lost Age".
[Tim Schuerewegen]

SSV: Hook up uPD96050 (ST-010) math/protection DSP [R. Belmont]

[mysticrib] added one opcode and fixed music and sound
[Roberto Zandona']

Fixed DISCRETE_WAVLOG & DISCRETE_RCFILTER fixing dkongjr and likely
other sounds. [Derrick Renaud]

intelfsh: Support flash ROMs that have a bankswitch command
[Tim Schuerewegen]

Fixed banking in daytona2 by adding a second aperture to CROM at
0xc3000000. A couple of CROMs checksum as bad, but most come out good.
[Aaron Giles]

A new WE DSP16A cpu disassembler.  [Andrew Gardner]

Added a preliminary Softlist support for Sega Megatech, that allows
multi-cart support. syntax is (similar to the MESS one)
mame megatech -cart1 mt_beast -cart2 mt_soni2 ... -cart8 mt_shar2
SMS games have issues when moving between games, so stick to only
a single SMS game for now or the z80 will crash. [David Haywood]

Fix missing sound channel in beezer; sound should now be more or less
correct, but the noise source still isn't accurate yet.
[Lord Nightmare]

Improved beezer volume DAC handling to be accurate to hardware.
[Lord Nightmare]

quizf1: added opcodes [Roberto Zandona']

C++-ified the sound and streams interfaces. Combined sound.c and
streams.c into one file, and separated the speaker device into its own
file. Generalized the concept of dynamically assigned inputs and
re-wired the speaker to work this way, so it is now treated just like
any other sound device. Added methods to the device_sound_interface
for controlling output gain and mapping device inputs/outputs to
stream inputs/outputs. Also made the sound_stream_update() method pure
virtual, so all modern sound devices must use the new mechanism for
stream updates. [Aaron Giles]

Clean up megatech.xml. [Fabio Priuli, David Haywood]

Clean up natural keyboard support. [Atari Ace]

Eliminated static/global variables in a number of Atari drivers by

Fix a bug in palette_normalize_range which caused color distortion.
The luminance normalization now converts r,g,b to y,u,v and normalizes
y prior to converting back to r,g,b. This affects e.g. radarscp, dkong
and mario drivers. [Couriersud]

Modernized the DSP32 core. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote video routines and fixed partial updates in the Dottori Kun
driver [Angelo Salese]

Added all CPU and sound devices in emu folder to the MAME build.
[Curt Coder]

arm7: [Tim Schuerewegen]
 - Improved LDM/STM unaligned word access in THUMB mode.
 - Fixed LDM unaligned read in THUMB mode.

Imported the MC68901 device from MESS so it can be shared with
micro3d.c. [Curt Coder]

ksys573: Hook up part of the i2c communication with the mas3507d.
[O. Galibert]

Renamed bishjan.c to subsino2.c [Luca Elia]
 * Implemented reel layer
 * Fixed rogue tiles in xplan
 * Hopper emulation in bishjan

m90: fixed line scroll [Roberto Zandona]

ARM7: Fix an LDM base register write-back bug. [Tim Schuerewegen]

Added correct LA revision levels to the Pigskin 621AD rom set as well
as including the date in the game titles of Arch Rivals and Pigskin
621AD sets. [The Dumping Union]

Fixed interrupt vector in F8 CPU core [Sandro Ronco]

namcops2: Added dumped key for Ridge Racer V RRV3 Ver. A [Guru]

Converted TMS3203X to a modern device. [Aaron Giles]

Removed redundant m_machine from the state and execute interfaces
to fix ambiguity when using m_machine from within a device that
inherits from these. [Aaron Giles]

beezer now uses correct mm5837 noise source (clock may be a bit off
though), and now has mm5837 properly hooked to audio via. May still be
some issues with intermittent noise updating which need fixing.
[Lord Nightmare]

Improvements to Magic's 10 driver. [Roberto Fresca]
 * New inputs from the scratch for Music Sort.
 * Complete DIP Switches and DIP locations for Music Sort.
 * Added a new button-lamps layout for Music Sort.
 * Created a default NVRAM that allow Music Sort work properly.

NetBSD support [Thomas Klausner]

pollux: fixed sprite flip x and y and removed old comments
[Roberto Zandona']

Converted attotime to a class, with proper operators. Removed old
global functions which are now superceded by the operators and methods
on the class. [Aaron Giles]

Eliminated global/static variables in a number of Taito/Irem drivers 
by introducing/using driver_device classes. [Atari Ace]

Cleaned up shared implementation of CDi [David Haywood]
 * merged MESS CDi driver file with the MAME CDi driver file (used for
    Quizard)
 * the cdimono1 system is now the parent / bios of Quizard, the Quizard
    games run on a retail CDi unit with Jamma adapter / dongle for
    protection so this is a logical step.

Replaced anonymous timers used in video/segaic16.c, drivers/segaorun.c
and drivers/segaxbd.c with allocated timers, making it possible to add
save state support to these drivers.  [Alex Jackson]

Updates to cave.c and toaplan2.c: [Alex Jackson]
 * Added savestate support to all games in cave.c. Most of the work
    was already done by someone else; the blocker was a
    perpetually-running anonymous timer, which I converted to an
    allocated timer.
 * Changed OKI sample banking to use device address maps instead of
    memcpy() in all cave.c games except the nmk112-based games. If
    someone wants to try to convert nmk112.c to use device address
    maps and bank pointers, be my guest--you'll need 8 banks of
    varying sizes per OKI chip...
 * Fixed description of the Japanese Air Gallet set--the game's
    Japanese title is "Akuu Gallet".
 * Made machine/nmk112.c actually restore its state properly. Also
    refactored it a little (if you can talk about refactoring a source
    file that almost fits on one screen)
 * Fixed bgaregga's nmk112 interface to work with the refactored
    nmk112.c.
 * Removed excessive CPU interleaving from batsugun, left over from
    when I was initially hooking up the V25.
 * Removed a useless printf and some obsolete comments, more leftovers
    from the process of hooking up the V25.

Added MCFG_SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS to twincobr.c and wardner.c, correcting
their refresh rates.  [Alex Jackson]

Add basic LOAD function to the debugger to complement the existing
SAVE function. It allows you to load a binary file straight into
writeable memory.  The format is the same as the SAVE function with
the exception that the <length> can be handled differently.  [Pugsy]

68681 patch to fix dectalk's startup test in MESS [Hans Ostermeyer]

drcuml: fix compile on systems that use the C backend [R. Belmont]

Reimplemented fruit-machine mechanical meters to use timers [AGEMAME]

Various MPU4 changes [AGEMAME]:
 * Revised timing/input system to stop flickering
 * Tidied up the LED drawing code to remove flicker
 * Support for all known extenders and reel multiplex boards used in
    MPU4 H/W
 * Partial support for OKI sampled sound card, need for some titles
 * Fixed Old Timer characteriser
 * Some general tidying up to allow better study of the BwB titles

Implemented proper mouse wheel event handling in the Windows debugger.
[Curt Coder]

Convert emu_timers to objects. Moved implementation and management of
timers into the scheduler. Retain TIMER devices as a separate wrapper
in timer.c/.h. Rather than using macros which hide generation of a 
string-ified name for callback functions, the new methods require 
passing both a function pointer plus a name string. A new macro 
FUNC() can be used to output both, and another macro MSTUB() can be 
used to output a stub-wrapped class member as a callback. [Aaron Giles]

Added a time() method on the machine, so that machine->time()
gives the current emulated time. [Aaron Giles]

Added methods to the device_t class that make creating and managing 
device timers much simpler. Modern devices were updated to use these.
[Aaron Giles]

Ensured that the debugger disassembly PC cursor is visible on startup.
[Curt Coder]

Made changes to the PORT_ADJUSTER values for MSM5232 clocks in all
games in drivers to best match PCB recordings.  [Fujix, Tafoid]

Removed cpuexec_describe_context, cpuexec_boost_interleave, 
cpuexec_trigger, and cpuexec_triggertime in favor of calls to the
scheduler. [Aaron Giles]

tms57002: significantly improved build speed on lower-end h/w
[R. Belmont]

G65816: fixed operation on PowerPC Linux where char is unsigned
[R. Belmont, billb]

Move generic templates from emucore.h to emutempl.h. Normalize the
tagged_list template to wrap a regular standard_list and have similar
semantics. Updated a few direct callers to handle the changes.
[Aaron Giles]

sigmab98: fixed zooming, added priorities and flipping [Luca Elia]

Moved the state saving system to C++. For now the registration macros
are still intact. The new state_manager class has templatized methods
for saving the various types, and through template specialization can
save more complex system types cleanly (like bitmaps and attotimes).
Added NAME() macro which is a generalization of FUNC() and can be used
to wrap variables that are registered when directly using the new
methods as opposed to the previous macros. [Aaron Giles]

Added new mechanism to detect proper state save types. This is much
more strict and there will likely be some games/devices that
fatalerror at startup until they are remedied. Spot checking has
caught the more common situations. [Aaron Giles]

Added methods in the device_t class that implicitly register state
against the current device, making for a cleaner interface. Bulk
updated existing devices and drivers with driver_device classes to
use these methods. [Aaron Giles]

cps1.c: CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
 * Added Tenchi wo Kurau (Japan Resale Ver.)
 * Confirmed B-Board # for chikij, added ROMs positions, PALs and some
    pcb infos to video\cps1.c
 * Fixed sf2uk labels and added pcb infos
 * Identified and documented willowje as an early and genuine USA
    release, added a note and renamed willowje -> willowo
 * Verified and fixed XTALs of Japan Resale Versions to work at 12MHz,
    they all use DASH A-Boards
 * Minor cleanups and fixes

Migrated allocated buffers to arrays in the driver_data classes of
several drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Made "run to next CPU" more reliable. [Aaron Giles]

Fix memory manager bug when calling 32-bit handlers on a 64-bit
address space. [Aaron Giles]

Improved sprite-tile priorities in SD Gundam Sangokushi Rainbow
Tairiku Senki [David Haywood]

V25: fix false warnings from some GCC versions [R. Belmont]

Improve TLB mismatch handling in PPC DRC, so that if we fill from an

Discrete sound system:
 * all nodes are now class based
 * removed all support for "legacy", i.e. procedural node functions.
 * nodes are created using a class factory whose instances are set up
    in discrete blocks. There is no separation of node vs. module any
    longer.
 * Custom modules are now just implemented like "normal" nodes.
 * Converted all custom modules.
- Context variables can now be migrated to be private class members.
[Couriersud]

cheat.c: added support for cheats with software list shortnames
[Fabio Priuli]

video.c: added support for a new template to -snapname so that it is
possible to use the name of images mounted in the devices (for MESS).
Namely, it is now possible to use %d_XXXX to prescribe usage of the
image mounted in the device XXXX. [Fabio Priuli]

clifront.c: improved the behavior of -listsoftware by updating DTD, by
adding output of most missing elements and attributes (softlist
description, features & diskdata) and by fixing size and offset
formats [Fabio Priuli]

clifront.c: added remaining loadflags to -listsoftware output
[Fabio Priuli]

Fixed an ARM7 R15 bit ignoring behaviour while in ARM state, fixes
Lupin the Third: the Typing ARM crashing when you coin it up.
[Tim Schuerewegen]

softlist.c: added best match suggestions to software lists
[Fabio Priuli]

softlist.c: only output best match if a list is present, limit the
scan for best match to the devices with the same interface and fixed a
corner case with shortname=listname [Miodrag Milanovic]

romload.c: added support for split set to softlist (for cart, cd and
hd) [Fabio Priuli]

devimage.c: added support for split set to softlist for cass and flop
too [Fabio Priuli]

allow software lists to look for files in the rompath too
[Fabio Priuli]

[Fabio Priuli]

Placed full megadrive code in MAME section [David Haywood]

softlists: added WARNING if loading a software with
supported="partial" or "no" [Fabio Priuli]

model3: redumped Daytona 2 Battle on the Edge CROMs [Guru]

Added FSAVE mode 2 support to the M68040 FPU. [Barry Rodewald]

Documentation update to beezer driver for facilitating future sound
work [Lord Nightmare]

Add missing XYZ latch readback on beezer, gets sound closer to working
[Lord Nightmare]

 * more code rewrite to get rid of fixed allocations.
 * performance about the same as 0.140

Added a mostly complete NEC V25/V35 CPU core, added working sound to
Batsugun and hooked up proper V35-controlled interrupts in Cosmic Cop
/ Gallop and Kengo [Alex Jackson]

Implemented proper RNG mechanism in Seibu COP emulation
[Tomasz Slanina, Angelo Salese]

MPU4 Changes: [AGEMAME]
 * Added fix for lamp 'open circuit' errors which in turn make Connect
    4 work better.
 * Fixed layout typo that caused the wrong piece to be displayed in
    Connect 4.
 * Documented the DUART and PTM better in MPU4 to allow for sampled
    sound changes later.
* Changed 'serial_card_connected_ to link 7a, as it is the jumper on
    the ROM card that changes the IRQ priority, not the serial 
    interface itself.

dogyuun: decrypted some opcodes [Roberto Zandona']

raiden2: Command 0205 changes data at +1c too [dox, O. Galibert]

raiden2: First stab at a cop "disassembler" [trap15, O. Galibert]

Redo most of the DRC/backend support as C++. Yes, it is intentional 
that the x86/x64 backends compile everywhere. Backends are now 
derived from drcbe_interface and implement several required overrides.
x86emit.h now uses namespaces so that the x86/x64 emitters can
co-exist. New file uml.h/uml.c actually describes the UML language, 
separating out several concepts from drcuml.c. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up clocks of mid to late 80s Nichibutsu non-Mahjong games.
Though not completely accurate yet, this should improve music speed
and DAC audio pitch a bit. [hap]

romload.c: made -bios option case insensitive [Fabio Priuli]

starfire.c: Improved color emulation and added driver data [Qwi Jibo]

toaplan2:
 * found a lot more kbash opcodes by matching code with batsugun's
    [Alex Jackson]
 * correct m68k and v25 address maps for kbash [Alex Jackson]
 * corrected truxton2 program ROM [Alex Jackson]

fixeight: added several opcodes [Roberto Zandona']

Simplified UML parameters, as follows: [Aaron Giles]
 * immediates can be passed raw, no IMM() wrapper required (and it's
    gone now)
 * fixed integer registers now use constants I0,I1,I2,etc instead of
    IREG(0),...
 * same for float registers F0,F1,F2,etc instead of FREG(0)
 * dynamic integer/float regs use inline functions ireg(),freg()
 * MEM macro is now a lower-case inline function mem()

Fixed a trivial boot vector program init bug in Lethal Thunder /
Thunder Blaster [Angelo Salese]

Added an opcode in Mystic Riders decryption table, makes BGMs to work
in mysticrib [Angelo Salese]

Added sound reset line for Irem M92 HW, and safely removed
GAME_IMPEFECT_SOUND flag to Perfect Soldiers [Angelo Salese]

Fix a bug in makedep which will caused includes on the first line of
the file like in skyraid.h to be ignored. [Couriersud]

Added working sound to Dogyuun and V-Five 
[Roberto Zandona', Alex Jackson]

toaplan2 improvements  [Alex Jackson]
 * Figured out which bit controls V25 RESET in each game by comparing
    the 68000 code
 * Added a comment about fixeight's I/O map, which we'll have to
    determine once we start decrypting it
 * Put #ifndef USE_ENCRYPTED_V25S around some simulation crap that was
    hiding in fixeight's DRIVER_INIT

segapcm.c: Fixed loop address, hangon engine sounds better now. Also
included documentation in source of known register functions. [hap]

madalien.c: Fixed highlighting in tunnel. [Qwi Jibo]

Fixed regressed flip screen support in Toaplan 2 games [David Haywood]

Changed the discrete sound system to be class based: [Couriersud]
 * Former modules are now classes being derived from
    discrete_base_node
 * Moved all context variables to be private class members.
 * For "standard nodes", DISCRETE_CLASS_STEP_RESET provides a simple
    way to implement a node.
 * All information around a node (additional info struct, constants
    and input mappings may be defined on a class level centralizing
    all information. An example is dss_inverter_osc.
 * Significantly simplified the task handling.
 * Fixed a bug which would not buffer secondary outputs.
 * All lists in sound/disc_* are now based on dynamic_array_t
    (discrete.h)
 * Changed all drivers to reflect the changes.
 * Custom modules are now just another node class.
 * No performance hit observed due to these changes.

Improvements to goldnpkr.c [Roberto Fresca]
 * Lots of changes to get working the Video Klein games.
 * Renamed witchcde to witchjol --> Jolly Witch (Export, 6T/12T ver
    1.57D).
 * Added Wild Witch (Export, 6T/12T ver 1.74A).
 * New video hardware and machine driver for Video Klein's extended
    tiles games.
 * Added Dallas DS1210 + battery backed RAM support to the Video Klein
    CPU boxed games.
 * Improved inputs for Jolli Witch and Wild Witch. Added the game
    selector switch.
 * Cleaned up some witch card sets.
 * Added technical and game notes.

m90: modified interrupt [Alex Jackson]

Replaced BSMT2000 HLE emulator with emulation of the original
TMS32015.
[Dr. Decapitator, Andrew Gardner, Quench, Guru, Ernesto Corvi, Peter
Grounds, Lord Nightmare, Aaron Giles]

M6801 changes: [Curt Coder]
 * added operating mode enum
 * fixed port writes
 * implemented SCI status follower bits

toaplan2:
 * Found a few more fixeight opcodes, by matching code in the
    interrupt routines with batsugun [Alex Jackson]
 * Corrected fixeight V25 address map (the YM2151 and OKI6295 are at a
    different location than the other games) [Alex Jackson]
 * Preliminary implementation of V25/V35 port output [Alex Jackson]

Optimized RC_INTEGRATE and TRANSFORM. Nice improvement. [Couriersud]

Changed all "output[0] = ..." into "set_output(0, ..)" calls. Rewrote
modules using "output[0]" as a latch as well. The purpose is to
decouple nodes from the discrete infrastructure implementation.
[Couriersud]

Added a virtual stream update function to the device sound interface.
Added a new stream_create that takes fewer parameters and calls the
device's stream update. Removed the stream update stub template.
Updated BSMT2000 and OKIM6295 to use the new interface for their
streams. [Aaron Giles]

fixeight: hooked up EEPROM [David Haywood]

Added preliminary working sound to beezer. [Lord Nightmare]

M6801 changes: [Curt Coder]
 * implemented port 3 strobed mode
 * fixed port writes some more

Discrete subsystem now uses the sound_device stream_update function.
[Couriersud]

Improve nmi handling in mouser. [Couriersud]

i8085.c: Fixed inte callback not being called when the IE flag was
cleared after the CPU received an interrupt. This fixes interrupts in
n8080.c helifire and spacelnc. [Qwi Jibo]

raiden2: Write down the rather weird results of a series of tests
[dox, O. Galibert]

Added "-syncrefresh" option to osd/sdl. This will *limit* the game
speed to the video refresh rate and works in -mt mode as well. The
option has an effect only if "-waitsync" is specified.
[Couriersud, Chris Kennedy]

Fixed 01004: chinhero, chinhero2, chinherot: There is a bad sprite on
level 7 of the game. [Corrado Tomaselli, Pierpaolo Prazzoli] Added
sprites wrap around-y in Chinese Hero to fix gorilla sprites entering
from the left [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

fixeight: decrypted all used opcodes and added EEPROMS for all
countries; now the sound works
[Andrew Jackson, David Haywood, Roberto Zandona']

fixeight: cleaned up the inputport for fixeight (no dips)
[David Haywood]

ARM7 updates [Tim Schuerewegen]:
 * Disable 26-bit back compatibility for ARM7 variants other than
    ARM7500
 * Fix carry flag issue on add/subtract in ARM mode

cb2001: reworked interrupt [Alex Jackson]

720 - added Driver Configuration option to allow the controls to be
set to Real 720 Controller Input; fake joystick; or fake spinner.  It
defaults to fake spinner for mouse/spinner use. [Derrick Renaud]

Changed the Analog Controls menu to only list controls selected in the
Driver Configuration. [Derrick Renaud]

ARM7 updates [Tim Schuerewegen]:
 * Fixed "MOV x, R15, LSL #y" form as tested by ARMWrestler
 * Added unimplemented Thumb MOV variant used by GBA Moto GP

Reorganized megadrive/sms sourcefiles for better sharing between
MAME/MESS. [Fabio Priuli]

NEC DSP updates [R. Belmont, byuu, Dr. Decapitator]:
 * Now supports uPD7725 and uPD96050
 * Hooked up SNES common code to use uPD96050 for ST-010/011
 * Removed ST-010 HLE simulation

Display suggestions in case commands that require game name are
called and there were no matching games  [Miodrag Milanovic]

Carved out a discrete_sound_device from discrete_device. This now has
all the stream related code. discrete_device thus now contains all the
generic code and may be used going forward to implement not sound
related use cases. [Couriersud]
